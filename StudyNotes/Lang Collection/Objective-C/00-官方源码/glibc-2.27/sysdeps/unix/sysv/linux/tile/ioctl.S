/* TILE-Gx specifies that "unsigned int" is sign extended in the high
   32 bits.  But since the userspace API claims to be "unsigned long",
   calls into __ioctl() will not be sign extended, but rather pass all
   64 bits of the argument.  Therefore, when we pass the "request"
   value to the kernel, we must explicitly sign-extend it to match the
   kernel's internal use of "unsigned int" as the second argument,
   which we do by casting to "unsigned int".  */
